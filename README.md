# HydroFloat-Dataset
Welcome to the GitHub repository of the HydroFloat Dataset. This dataset features images of six common types of floating debris: plastic bottles, plastic bags, cans, dead fish, water hyacinths, and foam. It is designed to aid the development of machine learning models for environmental monitoring and cleanup.

Dataset Description
The HydroFloat Dataset is dedicated to supporting environmental protection and cleanup projects by enabling the identification and classification of floating debris through machine learning technologies. The dataset was created to advance environmental technologies and increase public awareness of water pollution issues.
